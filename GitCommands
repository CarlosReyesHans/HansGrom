TODO

Merge with the one in Ubuntu


///// Commands!

git clone github_url local_directory
git commit
git push
git checkout -b myNewBranch fromThisOrigin

///// 	TO UPDATE A PROJECT

Create the project from the branch it will be normally used
Create the gitignore file
git touch .gitignore
Copy an example or extend the one it is already included

To merge the consequent branches without affecting the general independant structure
	of the branches:

git checkout develop	//imagine that the change was made in master and we want it to be in all the other branches
git merge --no-ff master	//master privails as develop has the last changes from master

git checkout feature
git merge --no-ff develop	//now feature has incorporated the updated version of develop, hence feature has the master's changes as well

/////	USING STASH
Before changing to any other branch when the modifications are not yet ready

git stash
After having shown what was needed and being again in the initial branch, 
	to recover what was previously stashed
git stash pop
